# Books To Read in 2024
In 2020 I read 34 books in 6 months, in 2022 I maybe read 10. I've gotten back into the habit of reading and I will be reading 
as much as possible.

## Rereads
I am a firm believer in rereading good books, and there are some books I reread every year. I include these on the list for
posterity's sake.
